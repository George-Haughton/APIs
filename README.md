## APIs

#### API (application program interface)
An API is a set of routines and tools for building applications. In essence and API specifies how the software components should interact. AN effetive API will make it easier for the developer to program the program they are developing. It does this by proiding all the building blocks for the programmer and all they have to do is put the blocks together.

#### The need for APIs
APIs are needed because they are used to do a specifice job, they save developers huge amounts of time by doing small tasks quickly, that would take a person hours to do. Additionally, they allow developers to do things that they just wouldnt be able to do if APIs didnt exist. Like scrapping a whole website and putting that informaton into a PDF folder which would normally take hours.

#### Examples of APIs:
- google maps 
- Linkedln
- Houndify
- NASA's API
- Gmail
- Github
- Twitter
- Dropbox
- Slack
- Facebook

#### Software development kit (SDK)
An SDK is like a workshop as it contains the necessary tools to aid you when coding. A few tools it provides are  code samples, libaries and relevant documentation.

#### Difference between an API and SKD
An API is a tool or building block that helps developers do something quickly or more efficent that if they were to do it without an API and an SDK is a kit or workshop that contains tools that will help developers code.
