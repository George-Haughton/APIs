## APIs

#### API (application program interface)
An API is a set of routines and tools for building applications. In essence and API specifies how the software components should interact. AN effetive API will make it easier for the developer to program the program they are developing. It does this by proiding all the building blocks for the programmer and all they have to do is put the blocks together.

#### The need for APIs
APIs are needed because they are used to do a specifice job, they save developers huge amounts of time by doing small tasks quickly, that would take a person hours to do. Additionally, they allow developers to do things that they just wouldnt be able to do if APIs didnt exist. Like scrapping a whole website and putting that informaton into a PDF folder which would normally take hours.

#### Examples of APIs:
- google maps 
- Linkedln
- Houndify
- NASA's API
- Gmail
- Github
- Twitter
- Dropbox
- Slack
- Facebook

#### Software development kit (SDK)
An SDK is like a workshop as it contains the necessary tools to aid you when coding. A few tools it provides are  code samples, libaries and relevant documentation.

#### Difference between an API and SKD
An API is a tool or building block that helps developers do something quickly or more efficent that if they were to do it without an API and an SDK is a kit or workshop that contains tools that will help developers code.

#### Improving a application using an API
On the google play store there is a game called Asphalt 9. It is a racing game where you can complete stunts, use nitros and race other online players. Using the API googlemaps you could turn the game into a car version of Pokemon go. Where you would walk around in real time searching for cars on the game while walking around your town or city. This would improve them game giving people the chance to go out and find the cars and then if they wanted to they could go back home and race they cars they have found, additionally, it gives players the option to trade and sell cars on an online market which I believe to me a lot more enjoyable.

#### White box testing
There are a few steps when it comes to White box testing. firstly, the tester will normally get a feel for the source code they are wokring with if they dont already know it. As white box testing is the testing of the inside of an application the tester needs to be very knowledgeable within the language the code is written in. Additionally,the tester must be up to date with secure coding practices so they can tell when the code is up to a high, secure standard. One of the most common reasons people white box test is to test security protocols of the code to make sure a hacker can not get in and inject it with malicous code. Lastly, the developer/tester will test the codes flow and structure they test this by writing code this will test the code itself. This part is often done by the developer as you will need intricute knowledge about the code itself. Another way to test the code is to manualy test it or through trial and error.

#### Black box testing
Black box testing is also know as behavioral testing, is a testing method where the tester does not know the internal structure, design and implementation of the item being tested, and these tests are normally functional though can also be non-functional. The name is a description of the item that the tester is testing as it is like a black box where the tester can not see what is inside the item. Within black box testing the tester will be looking for interface errors, behaviour or performance errors, errors in data structures, external database access, initialization errors, termination errors and incorrect or missing fucntions.
